# Student CRUD Application  

A React-based application for managing student records, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) student information. This project demonstrates essential React concepts, including data flow between parent and child components, the use of props, and callback functions for communication. Additionally, the `useEffect` hook is utilized to handle side effects and manage dependencies effectively.  

## Features  
- **Add, Update, and Delete Students**: Perform CRUD operations on student records dynamically.  
- **Parent to Child Communication**: Functions and props are passed from parent to child components for seamless interaction.  
- **Child to Parent Communication**: Callback functions in the child components are used to send data back to the parent component.  
- **useEffect Hook**: Demonstrates the usage of the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects and understand dependency management.  

## Technologies Used  
- **React.js**: For building user interfaces and managing state.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For application logic.  
- **CSS**: For styling the components.  

## Key Concepts  
### Parent to Child Communication  
- A function is defined in the parent component and passed to child components via props.  
- The child components use this function to access and modify the parent's state.  

### Child to Parent Communication  
- Callback functions are used to send data or trigger actions in the parent component.  
- This ensures bidirectional data flow between components.  

### `useEffect` Hook  
- Handles side effects such as data fetching or subscriptions.  
- Demonstrates dependency management for efficient and predictable component updates.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js installed on your system.  
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.
